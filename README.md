4. **Download ollama**

Ollama is an open source application for local inference, providing a large selection of quantitative models to run locally and an API compatible with the OpenAI API, greatly simplifying model management and inference.

This software uses Ollama for inference by default, so you will need to install Ollama first. You can download the platform-specific versions they offer from their [official website](https://ollama.com/).

Once you have downloaded and run it, type `ollama --version` in the terminal, and if the version number is output, the installation is successful.

5. **Download model:**

Currently, the default model used is `qwen2:1.5b`, which as an SLM model is able to run locally and has good performance.

You can find more information about this model [here](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen2-1.5B).

And to download the model in Ollama, just enter the following command in the terminal:

```sh
ollama pull qwen2:1.5b
```
